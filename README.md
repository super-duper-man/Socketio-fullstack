## Environment
To make the code work, you need to create .env file in backend directory and use your own MongoDB connection string and image repository.
I used MongoDB atlas and Cloudinary as image repository.

Complete environment code you need:

```
PORT=5001

MONGODB_URI=your-connection-string

JWT_SECRET=JWT_Secret_Key

NODE_ENV=development

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

```
